How do I perform a SQL injection attack on a vulnerable web application that uses string concatenation to build SQL queries?

I have a vulnerable SQL query that looks like this: sql = f"select * from county_health_rankings where county = '{county}' and state = '{state}' and measure_name = '{measure_name}'"

How can I modify the measure_name parameter to dump the entire database instead of just matching specific records?

What SQL injection techniques can I use to bypass WHERE clauses and return all rows from a table?

How do I use OR conditions in SQL injection to make WHERE clauses always return true?

What is the proper way to terminate a SQL string and add malicious conditions in a SQL injection attack?

How can I add a LIMIT clause to a SQL injection payload to prevent downloading too much data?
